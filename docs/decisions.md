# ECONEURA Architecture Decisions

## Repository Cleanup
**Decision**: Complete removal of all non-functional code and artifacts
**Context**: Repository contained excessive temporary files and scripts
**Consequences**:
- Clean, maintainable codebase
- Improved development experience
- Reduced repository size and complexity

## Template Method Pattern Implementation
**Decision**: Use template method pattern for system lifecycle management
**Context**: Need consistent initialization, validation, and cleanup across systems
**Consequences**:
- Standardized system behavior
- Reduced code duplication
- Easier maintenance and extension

## Inheritance-Based Architecture
**Decision**: Implement class-based inheritance in Bash scripts
**Context**: Complex systems need structured organization
**Consequences**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reusable base functionality
- Consistent error handling

## Automated Documentation System
**Decision**: Self-documenting system with changelog and decision tracking
**Context**: Need to track architectural changes and decisions
**Consequences**:
- Automatic documentation maintenance
- Historical record of changes
- Reduced manual documentation effort

## Comprehensive Test Suite
**Decision**: Automated testing framework for all system components
**Context**: Ensure system reliability and prevent regressions
**Consequences**:
- Continuous validation
- Early error detection
- Confidence in deployments

## Minimal Core Scripts
**Decision**: Keep only essential functional scripts
**Context**: Repository contained 170+ temporary/utility scripts
**Consequences**:
- Focused codebase
- Clear system boundaries
- Reduced maintenance overhead

## Quality Framework Standards
**Decision**: Implement strict quality gates and standards
**Context**: Ensure code quality and system reliability
**Consequences**:
- Consistent code quality
- Automated quality checks
- Professional development standards
